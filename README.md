# Campus 19 Common Core

An overview of the different projects in the common core at Campus 19 (42).

## Libft
Libft is a custom C library that reimplements essential functions from the standard library, along with additional utilities for string manipulation, memory handling, and linked lists. The project focuses on mastering fundamental programming concepts like pointer arithmetic, memory allocation, and algorithm design, while building reusable and efficient code.

This library serves as a foundation for future projects, ensuring a strong grasp of low-level programming in C. By creating these tools from scratch, it demonstrates proficiency in writing robust, modular, and well-documented code.

## ft_printf
ft_printf is a custom implementation of the C printf function, designed to handle formatted output with specifiers like %d, %s, %c, %p,%i, %u, %x and %X. The project showcases proficiency in handling variadic arguments, buffer management, and low-level input/output functions.

It demonstrates a strong understanding of modular programming, bitwise operations, and adaptability in implementing robust and efficient functionality found in standard libraries.

## get_next_line
Get Next Line is a function that reads a single line from a file descriptor in C, supporting both standard input and files. The project focuses on efficient memory management, buffer handling, and working with static variables to manage multiple file descriptors simultaneously.

This project highlights problem-solving skills and the ability to write robust code for dynamic input handling, which serves as a foundation for many real-world applications.

## minitalk
Minitalk is a simple client-server messaging system implemented in C using UNIX signals. The project focuses on sending and receiving messages between processes, using signals like SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 to transmit data one bit at a time.

This project demonstrates proficiency in interprocess communication, bitwise operations, and signal handling, showcasing the ability to work with low-level system programming concepts.

## push_swap
Push Swap is an algorithmic project in C that requires sorting a stack of numbers using two stacks and a predefined set of operations. The goal is to implement efficient sorting algorithms and minimize the total number of moves.

It emphasizes algorithm design, optimization, and understanding data structures, demonstrating problem-solving skills and the ability to write efficient and clean code.

## FdF
FDF is a 3D wireframe visualization program in C that reads data from a file and displays a graphical representation using isometric projection. Built using the MinilibX graphics library, the project involves rendering, event handling, and creating smooth animations.

This project showcases skills in graphical programming, mathematical transformations, and implementing interactive interfaces, providing insight into rendering techniques and low-level graphics handling.
