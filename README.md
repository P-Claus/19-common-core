# Campus 19 Common Core

An overview of the different projects in the common core at Campus 19 (42).

## libft <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/P-Claus/19-common-core/tree/main/ft_libft" />
Libft is a custom C library that reimplements essential functions from the standard library, along with additional utilities for string manipulation, memory handling, and linked lists. The project focuses on mastering fundamental programming concepts like pointer arithmetic, memory allocation, and algorithm design, while building reusable and efficient code.

This library serves as a foundation for future projects, ensuring a strong grasp of low-level programming in C. By creating these tools from scratch, it demonstrates proficiency in writing robust, modular, and well-documented code.

## ft_printf <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/P-Claus/19-common-core/tree/main/ft_printf" />
ft_printf is a custom implementation of the C printf function, designed to handle formatted output with specifiers like %d, %s, %c, %p,%i, %u, %x and %X. The project showcases proficiency in handling variadic arguments, buffer management, and low-level input/output functions.

It demonstrates a strong understanding of modular programming, bitwise operations, and adaptability in implementing robust and efficient functionality found in standard libraries.

## get_next_line <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/P-Claus/19-common-core/tree/main/get_next_line" />
Get Next Line is a function that reads a single line from a file descriptor, supporting both standard input and files. The project focuses on efficient memory management, buffer handling, and working with static variables to manage multiple file descriptors simultaneously.

This project highlights problem-solving skills and the ability to write robust code for dynamic input handling, which serves as a foundation for many real-world applications.
