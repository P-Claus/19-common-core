It demonstrates a strong understanding of modular programming, bitwise operations, and adaptability in implementing robust and efficient functionality found in standard libraries.

## get_next_line
Get Next Line is a function that reads a single line from a file descriptor in C, supporting both standard input and files. The project focuses on efficient memory management, buffer handling, and working with static variables to manage multiple file descriptors simultaneously.

This project highlights problem-solving skills and the ability to write robust code for dynamic input handling, which serves as a foundation for many real-world applications.

## minitalk
Minitalk is a simple client-server messaging system implemented in C using UNIX signals. The project focuses on sending and receiving messages between processes, using signals like SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 to transmit data one bit at a time.

This project demonstrates proficiency in interprocess communication, bitwise operations, and signal handling, showcasing the ability to work with low-level system programming concepts.

## push_swap
Push Swap is an algorithmic project in C that requires sorting a stack of numbers using two stacks and a predefined set of operations. The goal is to implement efficient sorting algorithms and minimize the total number of moves.

It emphasizes algorithm design, optimization, and understanding data structures, demonstrating problem-solving skills and the ability to write efficient and clean code.

## FdF
FDF is a 3D wireframe visualization program in C that reads data from a file and displays a graphical representation using isometric projection. Built using the MinilibX graphics library, the project involves rendering, event handling, and creating smooth animations.

This project showcases skills in graphical programming, mathematical transformations, and implementing interactive interfaces, providing insight into rendering techniques and low-level graphics handling.

## Philosophers
Philosophers is a simulation of the classic dining philosophers problem in C, designed to explore concurrency, thread synchronization, and resource management. Using threads and mutexes, the project tackles challenges like avoiding deadlocks and race conditions.

This project demonstrates a strong understanding of multithreading, synchronization primitives, and the complexities of parallel programming, essential skills for developing robust and efficient software.

## minishell
Minishell is a minimalist shell implementation in C that supports command execution, piping, redirections, and environment variable management. It involves parsing user input, managing processes, and implementing built-in shell commands.

This project showcases expertise in system programming, process management, and the intricacies of UNIX system calls, demonstrating the ability to create scalable and functional command-line applications.

## miniRT
MiniRT is a ray tracer in C that renders 3D scenes with basic geometric shapes (spheres, planes, and cylinders) and supports lighting effects like shadows, reflections, and ambient light. Built from scratch, the project involves implementing ray-object intersection algorithms and simulating light behavior.

This project demonstrates a strong grasp of mathematical concepts like vectors and linear algebra, as well as an understanding of rendering techniques and efficient computational algorithms used in computer graphics.

## CPP Modules
The CPP Modules series is a set of projects designed to introduce and solidify core concepts of C++ programming, focusing on object-oriented design, memory management, and advanced features of the language. Each module builds upon the previous, covering topics such as inheritance, polymorphism, templates, and exception handling.

These projects demonstrate a deep understanding of C++ principles, including writing clean, reusable, and efficient code, and provide hands-on experience in designing complex systems using modern programming paradigms.

## Inception
Inception is a systems project that involves setting up a multi-container application using Docker Compose. The project requires configuring Docker containers for services such as a web server (Nginx), a database (MariaDB), and a WordPress instance, all while ensuring proper networking and data persistence.

This project demonstrates expertise in containerization, orchestration, and infrastructure-as-code principles, showcasing the ability to design scalable and modular environments for modern software development and deployment.
